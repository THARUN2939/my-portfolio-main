                    I embarked my journey as a B.Tech Electronics and Communication& Engineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology in 2022. Along the way, I fearlessly explored various fields, including Creative thinking,and Entrepreneurship Ideas. I delved into the world of cutting-edge technologies, such as Python, Machine Learning, React, Nextjs, and Firebase. I also took my passion for technology and leadership to new heights by co-establishing International Society of Automation Chapter and the Blockchain Technology community club in my college, alongside my equally enthusiastic roommates. At present, I serve ISA chapter VIT as the Co-Lead and holds the significant responsibility of being the developer of Block-chain community club VIT VELLORE.
